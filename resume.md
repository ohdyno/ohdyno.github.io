# Resume

For me, software engineering has always been about the people. From the customers of the software
to its developers and business stakeholders, people make the software alive.

As such, throughout my professional career, I have been learning the perspectives, mastering the tools,
and challenging myself to make the software I touch pleasant for all stakeholders.

Discovering eXtreme Programming (XP) has been such a joy.
